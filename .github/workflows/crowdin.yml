# ** Synchronize Crowdin translation **
#
# Crowdin is a platform to manage the translation process in the Catroweb project:
#
#   1. We upload our english (base) translation files
#   2. Users worldwide translate our provided strings
#   3. We download the translations (In case translations are missing english is the fallback)
#
# This GitHub Action uses the official action from Crowdin to automate step 1 and 2.
# A pull request is created/updated automatically containing all new translations.
#
# - Secrets required!

*Pocket Mode is an Android app that locks your phone when you hover the proximity sensor.*

I have developed this app because stock Android lacks this feature and my phone always changes something or disables important things while laying inside the pocket. Seriously, this has had to be stopped.

Creating your Pocket Mode
----------------
We welcome all developers to use our source code to create applications on our platform.
There are several things we require from **all developers** for the moment:

1. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo as your app's logo.
2. Please remember to read and follow the [license][4].

Versioning
----------------
For transparency in a release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, a project should be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we should adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` and constructed with the following guidelines:
- Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major while resetting minor and patch
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor while resetting the patch
- Bug fixes and misc changes bumps only the patch
